Imagine this, you read a hundred amazing books in a year, you enjoy almost all of them and you are happy...right?
Well, wrong. Because suddenly someone asks what books you've read this year and you draw a blank. Sound familiar?

This webapp I created is meant to solve that program. With only a click (well, a few clicks) of a button, you can add all your favorite (and not so favorite)
books to the webapp. It features the ability to also write your thoughts about each single book as well as give them ratings.

So if anyone now asks what books you've read so far, simply direct them to the website.
