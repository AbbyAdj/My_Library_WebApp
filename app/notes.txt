This commit seeks to fix the issue with the Blueprint bug. The server needs to be able to reach the routes & various templates.

I will detail the issue/exact bug below:
1. I had to reference the modules properly in the models, routes and methods.
2. The methods module had to import the Books instance as well as the db initialized in the init.py

Notes:
1. I am making the first commit on this branch. In order for the user to be able to input their own book details,
instead of using the API, I added a new method (user_add_book). This is using the method add_new_books which I edited to
be able to handle creating a new book. This is still being worked on.
